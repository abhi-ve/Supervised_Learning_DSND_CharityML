Check out this __[Supervised Learning project](https://github.com/avelicha/Supervised_Learning_DSND_CharityML/blob/master/finding_donors_charityml.ipynb)__ I worked on as part of Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree program. In this project, I developed a machine learning model to best identify potential donors for a fictitious charity organization and reduce overhead cost of sending mail.
