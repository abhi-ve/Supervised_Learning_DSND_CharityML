Check out this __[Supervised Learning project](https://github.com/avelicha/Supervised_Learning_DSND_CharityML/blob/master/finding_donors_charityml.ipynb)__ I worked on as part of Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree program. In this project, I developed a machine learning model to best identify potential donors for a fictitious charity organization and reduce overhead cost of sending mail. Evaluated and optimized several different supervised learners to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield while also reducing the total number of letters being sent.
